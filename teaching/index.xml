      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the increasing advances of mobile and wearable technologies in people’s daily life, many biometrics and authentication techniques are being explored and developed (e.g., FaceID and TouchID). This course introduces students to the theory and practice of biometric (e.g., face and voice) authentication systems. The course will cover the fundamental principles of biometrics, including physiological and behavioral characteristics, and the algorithms and system architecture used to extract, represent, and match these characteristics. Students will also learn about the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the use of biometrics in security systems. The course will contain a semester-long project where students will group together to implement an authentication system prototype.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
