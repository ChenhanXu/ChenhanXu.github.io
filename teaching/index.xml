      <description>&lt;p&gt;Given the increasing advances of mobile and wearable technologies in people’s daily life, many biometrics and authentication techniques are being explored and developed (e.g., FaceID and TouchID). This course introduces how people use their biological features, such as fingerprints, irises, retina, face or voice for personal identification or verification. The course will cover both the theory and practice of biometric authentication systems, including human physiological and behavioral characteristics (what &amp;amp; why), and the hardware, algorithm, and system architecture used to extract, represent, and match these characteristics (how). Students will also learn about the ethical and legal considerations surrounding the use of biometrics in security systems.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
